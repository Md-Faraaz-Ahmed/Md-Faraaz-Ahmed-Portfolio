## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#1A237E) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness. The use of a darker hue in blue will pair well with the white background and pastel accent.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and minimal look. Offers good readability against the Navy Blue primary color.
- Accent color: Pastel blue (#A5D6A7). To add subtle contrast, while retaining the calming effect of the general color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and geometric feel.
- Minimal icon usage with FontAwesome or Lucide icons for key sections (skills, contact).
- Clean and minimal layout with a focus on readability and clear section separation. Implement a mobile-first responsive design with a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- Subtle animations on scroll for section reveals (fade + slide) and hover states for buttons/cards (scale & shadow).  Smooth scrolling for enhanced UX.
